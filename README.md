# Tables

Tables is a simple utility for reading and writing tabular data (a set of rows with a fixed number of named columns with consistent types per column), 
particularly CSV files.  This is not intended to be production grade.  If you are loading a large number of files or manipulating very large data sets, 
you would be better off using spark or some other tool.  I just use this to make simple utility classes to generate dummy data in various formats.
